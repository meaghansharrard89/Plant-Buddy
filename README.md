“Plant Buddy”- Meaghan/Esther

Project pitch

This project will be a list of specific plants/associated information pulled in from a public API, and clicking the plant name will bring up the plant image/plant information on the main part of the page. If you decide you want to buy this plant, you’ll select “Add to list” to add it to your shopping list. Clicking the plant name on the list will also remove it from the list.

User stories

1.	As a user, I want to be able to click on the plant name in the left-hand nav bar to have the plant name, image, and description populate in the main section of the page.
2.	If I like this plant, I want to be able to click “Add to list” to add it to my shopping list.
3.	Once added to my shopping list, it should also place a check mark next to the plant name in the nav bar.
4.	If I decide I no longer want to buy this plant, I want to be able to click on the plant name from the list to remove it.
5.	Removing this plant from the list should also remove the check mark from the nav bar.
6.	If I click on a different plant name in the nav bar on the page, it should replace the current plant in the main section.
STRETCH GOALS:
1.	Once added to my shopping list, it should also place a check mark next to the plant name in the nav bar.
